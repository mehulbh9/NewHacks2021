## Project Description
### Theme
Our project is in the theme of **productivity**. 

### Problem Statement
University and high school students struggle with productivity and managing time for their heavy course load. 

### Proposed Design
Automatic work load calendar that analyzes, for a user, their timetable, assignments and exams to generate a weekly calendar to help with time mangagement and productivity.

The program contains many more features to increase productivity and manage time effectively.

There is two test files `inputfile.txt` and `inputday.txt` being used with the example input but these files are not necessary (do not need to exist) and can be changed anytime

### List of Commands 
The user interacts with the program using key commands. After entering a command, the program asks for further input. 

* help
* course `add` / `delete`(`all`)
* assignment `add` / `delete`(`all`)
* exam `add` / `delete`(`all`)
* time `day` `hours` 
* print `day` / `all`
* list `course` / `all`
* pomodoro 
* exit
